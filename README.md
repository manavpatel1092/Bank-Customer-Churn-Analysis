## What is Churn Rate used for ? 
Churn rate is a measurement of the health of your business.

# Problem Statement
The bank has been seeing unusual churn rates for their customers. They want to understand the problem for this unusual high churn rates. Here we have been provided with a sample of their, last six months customers whose charecteristics like:
- credit score
- geography
- gender
- age
- tenure (how many years a customer is with the bank)
- balance
- number of products a customer had with the bank
- if he/she had a credit card
- if he/she is an active member
- estimated salary (the bank has estimated the salary based of the data they had)
- exited (if a customer has left the bank or not within the last six months)

Our task is to create a classification model for predicting customers at risk of churning. From this classification model the bank could gain useful insights and can take relevant actions to prevent further unusual churn rate and improve the overall customer experience. We would apply the ANN(Artificial Neural Networks) to classify the dataset and provide the bank with the best fit model.
