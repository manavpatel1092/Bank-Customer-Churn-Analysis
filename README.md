# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Repeat customers:
• Are loyal and satisfied
• Make multiple purchases
• Talk about your brand
• Refer your brand to their friends

However, maintaining your relationship with loyal customers can be tricky.These relationships need to be maintained with a consistent and rewarding customer experience. When your customers are happy, your business will prosper.

## What is Churn ? 
Customers that have churned are customers that have cut ties with a business or brand.

## What is Churn Rate used for ? 
Churn rate is a measurement of the health of your business.

##   Churn measures:
• The success of increasing customer retention for a company
• The changes that affect customer retention
• Customer Lifetime Value
• The type of customers that have the highest retention rate with your company
• Much more!

Today, we are going to analyse a customer dataset of a bank to provide them with valuable insights for their ongoing customer retention issue. We would apply the ANN(Artificial Neural Networks) to classify the dataset and provide the bank with the best fit model. The problem statement is mentioned in detail below.

# Problem Statement
The bank has been seen unusual churn rates for their customers (churn is when people leave the
company). They want to understand the problem for this unusual high churn rates. Here we have
been provided with a sample of their, last six months customers whose charecteristics like
• credit score
• geography
• gender
• age
• tenure (how many years a customer is with the bank)
• balance
• number of products a customer had with the bank
• if he/she had a credit card
• if he/she is an active member
• estimated salary (the bank has estimated the salary based of the data they had)
• exited (if a customer has left the bank or not within the last six months)

Our task is to create a classification model for predicting customers at risk of churning. From this classification model the bank could gain useful insights and can take relevant actions to prevent further unusual churn rate and improve the overall customer experience.
